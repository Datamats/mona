# Mona 3.0 Tweaked
This theme is a modification of the Mona 3.0 theme by Vasile Onofrei.
You can find the original theme [here](https://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Mona+-+Dark+and+blue+GTK+theme?content=168447).

## Installing
You can install by cloning this repository or extracting one of the [downloads](https://github.com/austinhartzheim/mona/releases) in either `~/.themes/` for a local install or `/usr/share/themes/` for a global install.

For example, this should create a local install:
```
mkdir -p ~/.themes/ && cd ~/.themes/
git clone https://github.com/austinhartzheim/mona.git
```

You can then select this theme with the Tweak Tool on Debian.

## Changes
* Add units where missing. Assuming "px" as this is what GTK assumes already.
* Fix the negative padding on notebook tabs. Also, increased padding slightly.

* Debian Jessie (GNOME 3.14): ✔ - thoroughly tested
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNOME 3.4): ✔ - some testing
* Ubuntu 15.10 (GNOME 3.16): ✔ - some testing
